# Hypothesis Testing

Scientific method applied to debugging. Every investigation is a series of falsifiable hypotheses.

## Falsifiability Requirement

A good hypothesis can be proven wrong. If you can't design an experiment to disprove it, it's not useful.

**Bad (unfalsifiable):**
- "Something is wrong with the state"
- "The timing is off"
- "There's a race condition somewhere"

**Good (falsifiable):**
- "User state is reset because component remounts when route changes"
- "API call completes after unmount, causing state update on unmounted component"
- "Two async operations modify same array without locking, causing data loss"

**The difference:** Specificity. Good hypotheses make specific, testable claims.

## Forming Hypotheses

1. **Observe precisely:** Not "it's broken" but "counter shows 3 when clicking once, should show 1"
2. **Ask "What could cause this?"** - List every possible cause (don't judge yet)
3. **Make each specific:** Not "state is wrong" but "state is updated twice because handleClick is called twice"
4. **Identify evidence:** What would support/refute each hypothesis?

## Experimental Design Framework

For each hypothesis:

1. **Prediction:** If H is true, I will observe X
2. **Test setup:** What do I need to do?
3. **Measurement:** What exactly am I measuring?
4. **Success criteria:** What confirms H? What refutes H?
5. **Run:** Execute the test
6. **Observe:** Record what actually happened
7. **Conclude:** Does this support or refute H?

**One hypothesis at a time.** If you change three things and it works, you don't know which one fixed it.

## Evidence Quality

**Strong evidence:**
- Directly observable ("I see in logs that X happens")
- Repeatable ("This fails every time I do Y")
- Unambiguous ("The value is definitely null, not undefined")
- Independent ("Happens even in fresh browser with no cache")

**Weak evidence:**
- Hearsay ("I think I saw this fail once")
- Non-repeatable ("It failed that one time")
- Ambiguous ("Something seems off")
- Confounded ("Works after restart AND cache clear AND package update")

## Decision Point: When to Act

Act when you can answer YES to all:
1. **Understand the mechanism?** Not just "what fails" but "why it fails"
2. **Reproduce reliably?** Either always reproduces, or you understand trigger conditions
3. **Have evidence, not just theory?** You've observed directly, not guessing
4. **Ruled out alternatives?** Evidence contradicts other hypotheses

**Don't act if:** "I think it might be X" or "Let me try changing Y and see"

## Recovery from Wrong Hypotheses

When disproven:
1. **Acknowledge explicitly** - "This hypothesis was wrong because [evidence]"
2. **Extract the learning** - What did this rule out? What new information?
3. **Revise understanding** - Update mental model
4. **Form new hypotheses** - Based on what you now know
5. **Don't get attached** - Being wrong quickly is better than being wrong slowly

## Multiple Hypotheses Strategy

Don't fall in love with your first hypothesis. Generate alternatives.

**Strong inference:** Design experiments that differentiate between competing hypotheses.

```javascript
// Problem: Form submission fails intermittently
// Competing hypotheses: network timeout, validation, race condition, rate limiting

try {
  console.log('[1] Starting validation');
  const validation = await validate(formData);
  console.log('[1] Validation passed:', validation);

  console.log('[2] Starting submission');
  const response = await api.submit(formData);
  console.log('[2] Response received:', response.status);

  console.log('[3] Updating UI');
  updateUI(response);
  console.log('[3] Complete');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('[ERROR] Failed at stage:', error);
}

// Observe results:
// - Fails at [2] with timeout → Network
// - Fails at [1] with validation error → Validation
// - Succeeds but [3] has wrong data → Race condition
// - Fails at [2] with 429 status → Rate limiting
// One experiment, differentiates four hypotheses.
```

## Hypothesis Testing Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Testing multiple hypotheses at once | You change three things and it works - which one fixed it? | Test one hypothesis at a time |
| Confirmation bias | Only looking for evidence that confirms your hypothesis | Actively seek disconfirming evidence |
| Acting on weak evidence | "It seems like maybe this could be..." | Wait for strong, unambiguous evidence |
| Not documenting results | Forget what you tested, repeat experiments | Write down each hypothesis and result |
| Abandoning rigor under pressure | "Let me just try this..." | Double down on method when pressure increases |

## Debug File Integration

After each hypothesis test, update the debug file:

- **Eliminated:** Append disproved hypothesis with evidence
- **Evidence:** Append what was discovered during the test
- **Current Focus:** Update with new hypothesis before proceeding

This creates an audit trail and prevents re-investigating dead ends after a context reset.
