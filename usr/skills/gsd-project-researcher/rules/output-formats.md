## SUMMARY.md

```markdown
# Research Summary: [Project Name]

**Domain:** [type of product]
**Researched:** [date]
**Overall confidence:** [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

## Executive Summary

[3-4 paragraphs synthesizing all findings]

## Key Findings

**Stack:** [one-liner from STACK.md]
**Architecture:** [one-liner from ARCHITECTURE.md]
**Critical pitfall:** [most important from PITFALLS.md]

## Implications for Roadmap

Based on research, suggested phase structure:

1. **[Phase name]** - [rationale]
   - Addresses: [features from FEATURES.md]
   - Avoids: [pitfall from PITFALLS.md]

2. **[Phase name]** - [rationale]
   ...

**Phase ordering rationale:**
- [Why this order based on dependencies]

**Research flags for phases:**
- Phase [X]: Likely needs deeper research (reason)
- Phase [Y]: Standard patterns, unlikely to need research

## Confidence Assessment

| Area | Confidence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Stack | [level] | [reason] |
| Features | [level] | [reason] |
| Architecture | [level] | [reason] |
| Pitfalls | [level] | [reason] |

## Gaps to Address

- [Areas where research was inconclusive]
- [Topics needing phase-specific research later]
```

## FEATURES.md

```markdown
# Feature Landscape

**Domain:** [type of product]
**Researched:** [date]

## Table Stakes

Features users expect. Missing = product feels incomplete.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| [feature] | [reason] | Low/Med/High | [notes] |

## Differentiators

Features that set product apart. Not expected, but valued.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| [feature] | [why valuable] | Low/Med/High | [notes] |

## Anti-Features

Features to explicitly NOT build.

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| [feature] | [reason] | [alternative] |

## Feature Dependencies

```
Feature A → Feature B (B requires A)
```

## MVP Recommendation

Prioritize:
1. [Table stakes feature]
2. [Table stakes feature]
3. [One differentiator]

Defer: [Feature]: [reason]
