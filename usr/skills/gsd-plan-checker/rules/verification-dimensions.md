# Verification Dimensions

Detailed criteria for the 7 plan verification dimensions used by `gsd-plan-checker`.

Load this file using `skills_tool` with `method=read_file` when running a full verification.

---

## Dimension 1: Requirement Coverage

**Question:** Does every phase requirement have task(s) addressing it?

**Process:**
1. Extract phase goal from ROADMAP.md
2. Extract requirement IDs from ROADMAP.md `**Requirements:**` line for this phase (strip brackets if present)
3. Verify each requirement ID appears in at least one plan's `requirements` frontmatter field
4. For each requirement, find covering task(s) in the plan that claims it
5. Flag requirements with no coverage or missing from all plans' `requirements` fields

**FAIL the verification** if any requirement ID from the roadmap is absent from all plans' `requirements` fields. This is a blocking issue, not a warning.

**Red flags:**
- Requirement has zero tasks addressing it
- Multiple requirements share one vague task ("implement auth" for login, logout, session)
- Requirement partially covered (login exists but logout doesn't)

**Example issue:**
```yaml
issue:
  dimension: requirement_coverage
  severity: blocker
  description: "AUTH-02 (logout) has no covering task"
  plan: "16-01"
  fix_hint: "Add task for logout endpoint in plan 01 or new plan"
```

## Dimension 2: Task Completeness

**Question:** Does every task have Files + Action + Verify + Done?

**Process:**
1. Parse each `<task>` element in PLAN.md
2. Check for required fields based on task type
3. Flag incomplete tasks

**Required by task type:**
| Type | Files | Action | Verify | Done |
|------|-------|--------|--------|------|
| `auto` | Required | Required | Required | Required |
| `checkpoint:*` | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| `tdd` | Required | Behavior + Implementation | Test commands | Expected outcomes |

**Red flags:**
- Missing `<verify>` — can't confirm completion
- Missing `<done>` — no acceptance criteria
- Vague `<action>` — "implement auth" instead of specific steps
- Empty `<files>` — what gets created?

**Example issue:**
```yaml
issue:
  dimension: task_completeness
  severity: blocker
  description: "Task 2 missing <verify> element"
  plan: "16-01"
  task: 2
  fix_hint: "Add verification command for build output"
```

---

## Dimension 3: Dependency Correctness

**Question:** Are plan dependencies valid and acyclic?

**Process:**
1. Parse `depends_on` from each plan frontmatter
2. Build dependency graph
3. Check for cycles, missing references, future references

**Red flags:**
- Plan references non-existent plan (`depends_on: ["99"]` when 99 doesn't exist)
- Circular dependency (A -> B -> A)
- Future reference (plan 01 referencing plan 03's output)
- Wave assignment inconsistent with dependencies

**Dependency rules:**
- `depends_on: []` = Wave 1 (can run parallel)
- `depends_on: ["01"]` = Wave 2 minimum (must wait for 01)
- Wave number = max(deps) + 1

**Example issue:**
```yaml
issue:
  dimension: dependency_correctness
  severity: blocker
  description: "Circular dependency between plans 02 and 03"
  plans: ["02", "03"]
  fix_hint: "Plan 02 depends on 03, but 03 depends on 02"
```

---

## Dimension 4: Key Links Planned

**Question:** Are artifacts wired together, not just created in isolation?

**Process:**
1. Identify artifacts in `must_haves.artifacts`
2. Check that `must_haves.key_links` connects them
3. Verify tasks actually implement the wiring (not just artifact creation)

**Red flags:**
- Component created but not imported anywhere
- API route created but component doesn't call it
- Database model created but API doesn't query it
- Form created but submit handler is missing or stub

**What to check:**
```
Component -> API: Does action mention fetch/axios call?
API -> Database: Does action mention Prisma/query?
Form -> Handler: Does action mention onSubmit implementation?
State -> Render: Does action mention displaying state?
```

**Example issue:**
```yaml
issue:
  dimension: key_links_planned
  severity: warning
  description: "Chat.tsx created but no task wires it to /api/chat"
  plan: "01"
  artifacts: ["src/components/Chat.tsx", "src/app/api/chat/route.ts"]
  fix_hint: "Add fetch call in Chat.tsx action or create wiring task"
```

---

## Dimension 5: Scope Sanity

**Question:** Will plans complete within context budget?

**Process:**
1. Count tasks per plan
2. Estimate files modified per plan
3. Check against thresholds

**Thresholds:**
| Metric | Target | Warning | Blocker |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| Tasks/plan | 2-3 | 4 | 5+ |
| Files/plan | 5-8 | 10 | 15+ |
| Total context | ~50% | ~70% | 80%+ |

**Red flags:**
- Plan with 5+ tasks (quality degrades)
- Plan with 15+ file modifications
- Single task with 10+ files
- Complex work (auth, payments) crammed into one plan

**Example issue:**
```yaml
issue:
  dimension: scope_sanity
  severity: warning
  description: "Plan 01 has 5 tasks - split recommended"
  plan: "01"
  metrics:
    tasks: 5
    files: 12
  fix_hint: "Split into 2 plans: foundation (01) and integration (02)"
```

## Dimension 6: Verification Derivation

**Question:** Do must_haves trace back to phase goal?

**Process:**
1. Check each plan has `must_haves` in frontmatter
2. Verify truths are user-observable (not implementation details)
3. Verify artifacts support the truths
4. Verify key_links connect artifacts to functionality

**Red flags:**
- Missing `must_haves` entirely
- Truths are implementation-focused ("bcrypt installed") not user-observable ("passwords are secure")
- Artifacts don't map to truths
- Key links missing for critical wiring

**Example issue:**
```yaml
issue:
  dimension: verification_derivation
  severity: warning
  description: "Plan 02 must_haves.truths are implementation-focused"
  plan: "02"
  problematic_truths:
    - "JWT library installed"
    - "Prisma schema updated"
  fix_hint: "Reframe as user-observable: 'User can log in', 'Session persists'"
```

## Dimension 7: Context Compliance (if CONTEXT.md exists)

**Question:** Do plans honor user decisions from `gsd-discuss-phase`?

**Only check if CONTEXT.md was provided in the verification context.**

**Process:**
1. Parse CONTEXT.md sections: Decisions, Claude's Discretion, Deferred Ideas
2. For each locked Decision, find implementing task(s)
3. Verify no tasks implement Deferred Ideas (scope creep)
4. Verify Discretion areas are handled (planner's choice is valid)

**Red flags:**
- Locked decision has no implementing task
- Task contradicts a locked decision (e.g., user said "cards layout", plan says "table layout")
- Task implements something from Deferred Ideas
- Plan ignores user's stated preference

**Example — contradiction:**
```yaml
issue:
  dimension: context_compliance
  severity: blocker
  description: "Plan contradicts locked decision: user specified 'card layout' but Task 2 implements 'table layout'"
  plan: "01"
  task: 2
  user_decision: "Layout: Cards (from Decisions section)"
  plan_action: "Create DataTable component with rows..."
  fix_hint: "Change Task 2 to implement card-based layout per user decision"
```

**Example — scope creep:**
```yaml
issue:
  dimension: context_compliance
  severity: blocker
  description: "Plan includes deferred idea: 'search functionality' was explicitly deferred"
  plan: "02"
  task: 1
  deferred_idea: "Search/filtering (Deferred Ideas section)"
  fix_hint: "Remove search task - belongs in future phase per user decision"
```
