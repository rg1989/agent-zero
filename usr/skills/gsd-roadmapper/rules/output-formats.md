## ROADMAP.md Template

**CRITICAL: ROADMAP.md requires TWO phase representations. Both are mandatory and must stay in sync.**

The two representations are:
1. A summary checklist under `## Phases` — one-liner per phase with checkbox
2. Detail sections under `## Phase Details` — full goal, requirements, success criteria per phase

If you only write the summary checklist, phase lookups will fail. Write both.

There is also a third required section: a progress table under `## Progress`.

```markdown
# Roadmap: [Project Name]

## Overview

[One paragraph describing the journey from start to finish]

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: [Name]** - [One-line description]
- [ ] **Phase 2: [Name]** - [One-line description]
- [ ] **Phase 3: [Name]** - [One-line description]
- [ ] **Phase 4: [Name]** - [One-line description]

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: [Name]
**Goal**: [What this phase delivers]
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: [REQ-01, REQ-02, REQ-03]
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
  2. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
  3. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
**Plans**: [Number of plans, e.g., "3 plans" or "TBD"]

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01: [Brief description of first plan]
- [ ] 01-02: [Brief description of second plan]
- [ ] 01-03: [Brief description of third plan]

### Phase 2: [Name]
**Goal**: [What this phase delivers]
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: [REQ-04, REQ-05]
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
  2. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
**Plans**: [Number of plans]

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: [Brief description]
- [ ] 02-02: [Brief description]

### Phase 2.1: Critical Fix (INSERTED)
**Goal**: [Urgent work inserted between phases]
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. [What the fix achieves]
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 02.1-01: [Description]

### Phase 3: [Name]
**Goal**: [What this phase delivers]
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: [REQ-06, REQ-07, REQ-08]
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
  2. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
  3. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
**Plans**: [Number of plans]

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: [Brief description]
- [ ] 03-02: [Brief description]

### Phase 4: [Name]
**Goal**: [What this phase delivers]
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: [REQ-09, REQ-10]
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
  2. [Observable behavior from user perspective]
**Plans**: [Number of plans]

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: [Brief description]

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 2 → 2.1 → 2.2 → 3 → 3.1 → 4

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. [Name] | 0/3 | Not started | - |
| 2. [Name] | 0/2 | Not started | - |
| 3. [Name] | 0/2 | Not started | - |
| 4. [Name] | 0/1 | Not started | - |
```

**Two-representation requirement:** The `## Phases` checklist and the `## Phase Details` section must always stay in sync. Every phase listed in the checklist must have a corresponding `### Phase N: Name` header in Phase Details. Every phase in Phase Details must appear in the checklist. When adding, removing, or renaming phases, update both representations.

**The `### Phase X:` headers are parsed by downstream tools.** If you only write the summary checklist, phase lookups will fail.

**Status values:**
- `Not started` — Haven't begun
- `In progress` — Currently working
- `Complete` — Done (add completion date)
- `Deferred` — Pushed to later (with reason)

**After milestones ship:** Collapse completed milestone phases under a `<details>` block with milestone header. Keep continuous phase numbering — never restart at 01. Add a Milestone column to the progress table.

## STATE.md Initial Structure Template

STATE.md is the project's short-term memory. Keep it under 100 lines. It is a DIGEST, not an archive.

```markdown
# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated [date])

**Core value:** [One-liner from PROJECT.md Core Value section]
**Current focus:** [Current phase name]

## Current Position

Phase: [X] of [Y] ([Phase name])
Plan: [A] of [B] in current phase
Status: [Ready to plan / Planning / Ready to execute / In progress / Phase complete]
Last activity: [YYYY-MM-DD] — [What happened]

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: [N]
- Average duration: [X] min
- Total execution time: [X.X] hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: [durations]
- Trend: [Improving / Stable / Degrading]

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase X]: [Decision summary]
- [Phase Y]: [Decision summary]

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

None yet.

## Session Continuity

Last session: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
Stopped at: [Description of last completed action]
Resume file: [Path to .continue-here*.md if exists, otherwise "None"]
```

**STATE.md lifecycle:**

- **Creation:** After ROADMAP.md is created — reference PROJECT.md, initialize empty accumulated context sections, set position to "Phase 1 ready to plan"
- **Reading:** First step of every workflow — present status, inform planning, know current position
- **Writing:** After every significant action — update position, note new decisions, add blockers/concerns
- **Size:** Keep under 100 lines. Keep only 3-5 recent decisions in summary (full log in PROJECT.md). Remove resolved blockers.
