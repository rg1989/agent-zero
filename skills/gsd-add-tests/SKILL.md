<codex_skill_adapter>
Codex skills-first mode:
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-add-tests`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-add-tests` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

Legacy orchestration compatibility:
- Any `Task(...)` pattern in referenced workflow docs is legacy syntax.
- Implement equivalent behavior with Codex collaboration tools: `spawn_agent`, `wait`, `send_input`, and `close_agent`.
- Treat legacy `subagent_type` names as role hints in the spawned message.

<objective>
Generate unit and E2E tests for a completed phase, using its SUMMARY.md, CONTEXT.md, and VERIFICATION.md as specifications.

Analyzes implementation files, classifies them into TDD (unit), E2E (browser), or Skip categories, presents a test plan for user approval, then generates tests following RED-GREEN conventions.

Output: Test files committed with message `test(phase-{N}): add unit and E2E tests from add-tests command`

Preserve all workflow gates (classification approval, test plan approval, RED-GREEN verification, gap reporting).
