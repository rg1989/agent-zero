<codex_skill_adapter>
Codex skills-first mode:
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$gsd-health`.
- Treat all user text after `$gsd-health` as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

Legacy orchestration compatibility:
- Any `Task(...)` pattern in referenced workflow docs is legacy syntax.
- Implement equivalent behavior with Codex collaboration tools: `spawn_agent`, `wait`, `send_input`, and `close_agent`.
- Treat legacy `subagent_type` names as role hints in the spawned message.
